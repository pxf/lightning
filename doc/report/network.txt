Distributing a (sub-)batch.

1) A batch is created by the batch owner and sends all the necessary information
	to it's local client.
2) The client asks the tracker for nodes along with information about how big the
	job is, and how many nodes it needs.
3) The tracker gives nodes to the client.
4) The client fills his local work queue and distributes the rest of the tasks
	to the connected nodes.
5) Point 2-4 is done in each client until no more nodes are available.
6) If there still are remaining tasks the client sets a flag telling the tracker
	to give any free nodes to the waiting client so that the rest of the tasks
	can be distributed and worked on.
